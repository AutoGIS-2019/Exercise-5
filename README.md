# Exercise-5

This week we will practice how to create **static and interactive maps using Python**. The goal of this exercise is to allow you to focus on cartographic visualization with Python, and to play around and explore different possibilities of the available visualization packages.

In this exercise, there is no ready-made Notebook-file to start with. All instructions are given in this readme.md -file and you should create all necessary files for completing the exercise (notebook-file or a python script file, and the output maps in `.png` and `.html` format). 

For this exercise a folder called **`docs`** has been created for storing and publishing the outputs. You should store the output maps under the `docs` folder (problems 1 and 2), and publish them online (problem 3).

**EXPECTED OUTPUTS:**
- Complete the mid-term feedback :)
- At least 1 static map in `.png` format stored in the `docs`-folder (problem 1)
- At least 1 interactive map in `.html` formad stored in the `docs`-folder (problem 2)
- All codes (`.ipynb` or `.py` -files) and input data (or links to input data) provided in this exercise-5 repository (problems 1 and 2)
- Published maps at: `https://autoGIS-2018.github.io/exercise-5-YourGitHubUsername/filename*` containing online versions of your interactive and static maps (problem 3) 
- Links to the published maps stored in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md) (problem 3)

For both maps, think a bit about the audience of the map, and pay attention to your cartographic choises. You can read a few useful hints about [what to consider when creating maps from this post](https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map/). 

- **Exercise 5 is due by the end of day on Wednesday the 5th of December.**

- Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points. 


## Problem 0: Feedback for the first half of the course in Period II

Having completed the first half of the AutoGIS course, we would again ask you to complete [this mid-term feedback form](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/84893/lomake.html) to help us
to continue developing and improving the course.



## Problem 1: Visualize a static map (8 points)

- Your task is to create a nice static map using the skills you leared in [lesson 5: static maps](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2018/notebooks/L5/static_maps.html). **Create as interesting, good and beautiful STATIC map(s) as you can**.
- **Topic of the map:**
  - You can select the topic of the map freely. **Use your imagination.**
  - Feel free to adapt examples provided in this course! You can e.g. do some calculations based on the datasets used during this course (travel time data, population data, address points..) or use the analysis outputs that we have done earlier in the course (for example the dominance areas or travel times for shopping centers). 
- **Criteria:**
  - The map should have multiple layers on it and/or present an output of a (simple) data analysis
  - Consider [good cartographic practices](https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map/)
  - The map should demonstrate skills learned during [lesson 5: static maps](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2018/notebooks/L5/static_maps.html) and throughout this course.
- **Output:**
  - Remember to commit the code you used for generating the plots (also provide the data, or at least a link to the input data used)
  - Save your map(s) as png image
  - store the output file(s) in the **`docs`** folder (You will need the png files in problem 3!)
  

## Problem 2: Visualize an interactive map (10 points)

- Your task is to create a nice INTERACTIVE map using the skills you leared in [lesson 5: interactive maps](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2018/notebooks/L5/interactive-map-folium.html). **Create as interesting, good and beautiful INTERACTIVE map(s) as you can** using either Folium or mplleaflet. 


- **Topic of the map:**
  - You can select the topic of the map freely. **Use your imagination.**
  - This map should not be only an interactive version of your submission for problem 1 ;). Create shomething new!
  - Feel free to adapt examples provided in this course! You can e.g. do some calculations based on the datasets used during this course (travel time data, population data, address points..) or use the analysis outputs that we have done earlier in the course (for example the dominance areas or travel times for shopping centers). 
- **Criteria:**
  - The map should have multiple layers on it and/or present an output of (simple) data analysis
  - Consider [good cartographic practices](https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map/)
  - The map should demonstrate skills learned during [lesson 5: interactive maps](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2018/notebooks/L5/interactive-map-folium.html) and throughout this course. You can also take advantage of the [Folium example gallery](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/python-visualization/folium/tree/master/examples/).
  - Think about including additional interactive elements, such as popup text in the map.
- **Output:**
  - Remember to commit the code you used for generating the plots (also provide the data, or at least a link to the input data used)
  - Store the interactive map(s) in .html format
  - store the output file(s) in the **`docs`** folder (You will need the png files in problem 3!)


## Problem 3: Publish your maps online (2 points)

 You should now have **ALL** your maps stored in the **`docs`** folder inside this repository
- Add links to those maps in the specific Entrance page [index.md -file](docs/index.md) that you can find in the **docs** folder. 
- There are more instructions how the links should be formatted in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md) 
- Provide a short description of each map in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md)
- Publish your maps with github pages 
  - the url of your page will be `https://autoGIS-2018.github.io/exercise-5-YourGitHubUsername`
  - See instructions how to edit settings and publish the page on the course webpages [here](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2018/lessons/L5/share-on-github.html#sharing-interactive-plots-on-github).
  - IF you feel like it, please share your published page in our Slack channel! :)
